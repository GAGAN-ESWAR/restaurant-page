# 🍽️ Spicewood Restaurant Website

Welcome to the repository of **Spicewood**, a modern restaurant website built using **Webpack** and **modular JavaScript**.  
This project is part of my learning journey to practice bundling, modular code organization, and deploying with GitHub Pages.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Single-page restaurant website with **modular JavaScript** components (`Home`, `Menu`, `About`).
- **Webpack bundling** for efficient asset management.
- **CSS Modules** for styling each page separately.
- Images and other assets handled via **Webpack loaders**.
- Responsive grid-based menu section.
